# WayPoint 🧭

[中文文档](README_CN.md)

**WayPoint** is a powerful macOS utility designed to revolutionize how you navigate your file system. It acts as a smart, central hub for your file paths, allowing you to jump between folders, open projects in your favorite tools, and even inject paths into system file dialogs with lightning speed.

> ⚡️ **Extreme Efficiency:** Open any target folder with as few as 3 keystrokes: `⌥ Space` (Invoke) -> `Search` -> `Enter` (Open).

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **⚡️ Instant Access:** Trigger WayPoint globally with a hotkey (Default: `Option + Space`) to immediately start searching your path history.
*   **🔍 Fuzzy Search:** Intelligent search algorithm that supports fuzzy matching. It prioritizes results based on exact matches, prefixes, usage frequency, and more.
*   **📂 Finder Sync:** Automatically tracks the path of your currently active Finder window. WayPoint knows where you are. *(Requires Accessibility Permissions)*
*   **📋 Clipboard Monitoring:** Smartly detects when you copy a file or a path string to your clipboard and automatically adds it to your history.
*   **🏗 Open Architecture (v1.3.0+):**
    *   **Customizable UI:** Toggle visibility for Tags, Scores, and Status Info. Make it as minimalist or as detailed as you like.
    *   **Programmable Toolbar:** Enable, disable, and reorder standard actions via drag-and-drop to match your unique muscle memory.
    *   **Tunable Scoring:** Adjust the weights for Frequency, Recency, and Prediction. Set custom path multipliers to boost or demote specific folders.
    *   **Portable Config:** Export and import your rules and preferences as a JSON file.
*   **🛠 Powerful Actions:**
    *   **Open:** Reveal in Finder.
    *   **Terminal:** Open directory in iTerm2, Warp, or Terminal.app.
    *   **Editor:** Open in VS Code, Cursor, Zed, or your preferred IDE.
    *   **Copy:** Copy path to clipboard.
    *   **💉 Inject:** Magic feature! Instantly navigate to a selected path within any system "Open" or "Save" dialog.
    *   **Context Rules:** Automatically shows "npm start", "Install Deps", "Docker Up", etc., based on folder contents.
*   **⭐️ Favorites & History:** Pin frequently used paths to your "Favorites" tab for permanent access.
*   **🤖 System Search:** Seamlessly falls back to Spotlight search (`mdfind`) when a local match isn't found.

## 🛠 Installation & Build

## 📖 Usage Guide

WayPoint requires **Accessibility Permissions** for monitoring Finder and injecting paths. Grant them in `System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility`.

### Basic Interaction
*   **Toggle Window:** `Option + Space` (default).

*   **Rules:** Create your own terminal commands triggered by specific files.

## 🏗 Technologies
*   **SwiftUI:** Modern, declarative UI.
*   **Combine:** Reactive state management.
